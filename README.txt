Hi. This code is to demonstrate how Genetic Algorithm (GA) and convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) can be combined together.
This, however, is mere example of these combination. Thus, the real code is confidential
because it is copyrighted by university.
In my fyp, I use GA to recombining different kind of parameters for 3 Layers and
5 Layers CNN
In this example, I am using 1 Layer CNN
Please noted that the higher population, the higher computation used.
that is one thing.
the other thing that affect our computation is Dense layer.
this layer is computationally overkilled.
Thus, search space and CNN could exceed your virtual memory.
It is working, but if you have any suggestion for add-on, please kindly email to me
